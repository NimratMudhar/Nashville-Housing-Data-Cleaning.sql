# Nashville Housing Data - Data Cleaning in SQL Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Nashville Housing Data - Data Cleaning in SQL" project. This project aims to clean and preprocess a dataset containing Nashville housing data using SQL queries. The dataset contains information about various housing properties in Nashville, including details such as property type, location, price, square footage, and more.

In this project, we leverage the power of SQL to perform data cleaning tasks, ensuring that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis. We address issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, and outliers to create a clean and reliable dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is on [Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.csv](https://github.com/NimratMudhar/Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning.sql/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.csv).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
  
2. Make sure you have an SQL database management system installed eg SSMS.

3. Execute the SQL scripts provided in the `sql` directory sequentially to create and populate the necessary tables.

## Usage

1. Open your SQL database management system and connect to the database where you executed the scripts.

2. Use SQL queries provided in the `sql` directory to perform various data cleaning tasks on the Nashville housing dataset.

3. Document your steps and changes within the SQL scripts for future reference.

## Data Cleaning Tasks

The following data-cleaning tasks are addressed in this project:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and handling missing values in columns such as square footage, number of bedrooms, price, taxes, and property type, etc.

2. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensuring consistent formatting for columns like property addresses, ensuring they follow a uniform structure.

3. **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate property listings from the dataset.

4. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and addressing outliers in price and square footage columns that might distort the analysis.

5. **Data Type Conversion**: Converting data types to ensure accurate analysis, such as converting textual representations of numbers to numeric data types.

6. **Normalization**: Normalizing data where necessary to bring it into a standard format.

7. **Verification and Validation**: Cross-checking cleaned data to ensure accuracy and integrity.
